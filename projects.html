          <h2>8 Wishes</h2>
          <p>
            This projects is still my favourite. I enjoyed the idea behind, plus
            it was our team's first serious project and we had many challenges
            building it. But that made the result all more rewarding. This
            project is a PWA (Progressive Web App) that allows users to make
            gift idea lists for themselves or their loved ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the Front-End we still used HTML5, CSS3 and Sass, Vanilla
            Javascript. Reading from Figma to develop the design on the live
            platform. As first team project we had to use version control, so we
            learned Git and GitHub. At the backend, we used Firebase and
            FireStore. This was also a PWA.

          <h2>Bureau of Skincare - BOS</h2>
          <p>
            BOS is a web platform that helps users track their skincare routine
            to monitor their skin health. The platform also provides the
            environment details about a user's location.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked as a Full-Stack Developer in this project. For the Front
            End we had to learn React.js from scratch, with the help of CSS3,
            Material UI we matched designers' prototypes. For the Back End we
            used Firebase for authentication and MongoDB for the database, also
            Node.js and Express.js. To help us add data we used Weather and
            Sephora APIs. To visualize data our team used Chart.js.

          <h2>YVR Views</h2>
          <p>
            This was one of my personal projects. I completed it while learning
            React.js, React Router. This website lets you add some of your
            favourite viewpoints in Vancouver.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly to the previous project, I used React.js, MongoDB and
            Heroku to deploy.
