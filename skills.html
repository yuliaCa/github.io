          <h2>Front-End</h2>
          <p>
            I am very confident in my front-end skills. I have learned
            <strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript </strong>. Also, I have some
            experience with <strong>React.js</strong>. Moreover, I know how to
            use <strong>Bootstrap and Material UI</strong> to create responsive
            websites. I particularly enjoy reading prototypes created by
            designers in <strong>Figma</strong>
            and making them come to life as accurately as possible.
          </p>

          <h2>Back-End</h2>
          <p>
            I have learned how to use <strong>Node.js and Express</strong> to
            create a server-side application. I have also learned how to use
            <strong>MongoDB </strong>to create a database. I have also learned
            how to use <strong>Postman </strong>to work with
            <strong> RESTful API </strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In one of the projects, I also had exposure to
            <strong>mySQL</strong> database. Overall I enjoyed
            <strong>database design</strong> fundamentals and I am looking
            forward to learning more about databases.
          </p>
          <h2>Additional</h2>
          <p>
            I know <strong>Git and GitHub</strong>. I have solid understanding
            of <strong>Agile, Scrum</strong> environment concepts. I am familiar
            with <strong>React Native and Expo</strong>. I have also learned
            <strong>native Android and iOS</strong> development using Java and
            Swift.
          </p>

          <p>
            Among other skills, I also posses non-technical skills that stem
            from my years of work experience and education. These skills
            include, strong communication skills, public speaking, presentation
            skills. I have many years of people management experience, which
            include training and other supervisory responsibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            With all of the above skills listed, it is, surely, a confirmation
            of my ability to learn quickly. I am an enthusiastic learner and my
            strong self-motivation helps me achieve set goals successfully,
            efficiently and timely.
