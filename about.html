          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Yulia Kirienko (she/her). I am a Software Developer in
            Vancouver, BC. I am passionate about using technology as a solution
            to real-life problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have recently graduated from Web an Mobile App Design and
            Development program at Langara College. During my studies, I have
            learned many new skills, not only technical, but people skills as
            well. I have learned how to work in a versatile team, where the
            members have different backgrounds. I have also learned how to work
            independently and how to manage my time effectively. As a team of
            designers and developers, we created several projects that offered a
            solution to some real-life problem we had identified. We mostly
            worked remotely in an agile environment. I have been able to refine
            and strengthen my public speaking skills and re-discover my aptitude
            for presenting.
          </p>
          <h2>Why Software Development</h2>
          <p>
            After working in the hotels industry for several years, I I had
            grown to realize that I needed something else in my career. While
            hospitality industry always puts people first, there are still some
            administrative procedures and tasks that need to be completed. With
            that, I have discovered in myself a passion for examining, analyzing
            procedures and looking for ways to make them more efficient. Leaving
            technology do tedious and repetitive tasks, we can have more time
            for things that matter the most - people.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the search of new career avenues I have stumbled upon web
            development, which, to my surprise, quickly enticed me. One of the
            main reasons, why I decided to take a leap and try myself in
            Software Development, is the ability and skills that allow me create
            tools, which help people and workplaces achieve their goals with
            less effort and time.
          </p>
          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            Being originally from Russia, I have received my Bachelor's Degree
            in International Relations there. That education program allowed me
            discover and develop one of the most important skills, that define
            me to this day - critical thinking. Approaching every task
            scrupulously, understanding its purpose and importance, allowed me
            to find great motivation in completing it successfully. At the same
            time, if I find an opportunity to improve the process, I gladly take
            it, sharing my ideas and propositions with my team.
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduating university in 2011, I moved to Canada. Back then I
            was sure hospitality was my passion. After taking some English
            courses, I started Hospitality Management Diploma Program at the
            SELC Career College in Vancouver, BC. After working in the industry
            for several years, I came to understanding that other,
            non-hospitality, aspects of each job intrigued me more. Hence, I
            have started exploring other career options by doing some research,
            taking courses.
